# Malaria_Detector

Built a Machine Learning solution that can help detecting
presence of Malaria parasite in image of blood cell. This is done by using feature extraction techniques called contour detection
and then applied RandomForest Classifier algorithm using scikit
learn module.

1)Download the cell images from here https://drive.google.com/file/d/1azIYjzLFCY7qp7-NjgSBvakbGgPvQlRf/view
2)Run the train.py to read cell images and generate the CSV file for training and test data.
